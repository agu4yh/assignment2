    "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is about tidy data, and how to make data cleaning as efficient and easy as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The tidy data standard has been designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to symplify the developement of data analysis tools that work well together.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  The first scentence means that tidy datasets are cleaned to be organized in the same manner, while messy datasets can be organized in a variety of different ways, making them less predictable and difficult to dive into analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: \"usually either numbers (if quantitiative) or strings (if qualitative).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: \"contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations: \"contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tidy data is defined as \"the standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to it's structure\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are when column headers are values and not variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in table 4 are messy because they use 3 variables (religion, income and freuency) which are stored in both columns and rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Melting\" a dataset is the process of tidying it by turning columns into rows. \"Melting is parameterised by a list of columns that are already variables, or colvars for short. The other columns are converted into two variables: a new variable called column that contains repeated column headings and a new variable called value that contains the concatenated data values from the previously separate columns.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 11 is messy because it has a column for each instance of a day variable (d1, d2, d3, ... etc.). In contrast, table 12 is tidy because each instance of a variable is within it's column, including the day variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
